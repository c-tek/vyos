```json
{
  "info": {
    "name": "VyOS API Collection",
    "description": "API endpoints for VyOS management"
  },
  "item": [
    {
      "name": "Subnet Management",
      "item": [
        {
          "name": "Create Subnet",
          "request": {
            "method": "POST",
            "url": "{{baseUrl}}/v1/subnets/",
            "body": {
              "mode": "raw",
              "raw": "{\n  \"name\": \"Development\",\n  \"cidr\": \"10.0.1.0/24\",\n  \"gateway\": \"10.0.1.1\",\n  \"vlan_id\": 100,\n  \"is_isolated\": true\n}",
              "options": {
                "raw": {
                  "language": "json"

## 4. Testing Enhancements

**Objective**: Improve test coverage and testing infrastructure.

### Tasks:

#### 4.1. Increase Test Coverage (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Add unit tests for recently added features
- [ ] Implement integration tests for feature interactions
- [ ] Set up code coverage reporting

#### 4.2. Setup CI/CD Pipeline (Priority: Low)
