# Phase 3: Operational Robustness & Advanced Features - Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for features in Phase 3 of the VyOS VM Network Automation API roadmap. This phase focuses on enhancing the operational aspects and introducing more advanced network automation capabilities.

## Features to be Implemented in Phase 3

### 1. VyOS Configuration Synchronization and Rollback

*   **Objective:** Ensure database and VyOS configurations are always in sync and provide recovery mechanisms for failed operations.
*   **Current Status:** Implemented.
*   **Details:** The `/v1/admin/sync-vyos-config` endpoint is implemented to compare and synchronize VyOS NAT rules with the database. It identifies and applies `set` or `delete` commands for discrepancies. Database operations are atomic. Rollback mechanisms are conceptually outlined in `docs/operations.md`. Documentation has been updated in `README.md`, `docs/api-reference.md`, and `docs/operations.md`.

### 2. Advanced Port Management

*   **Objective:** Provide more granular control over port forwarding rules, allowing for more specific and flexible NAT rule configurations.
*   **Current Status:** Implemented.
*   **Details:** The `VMPortRule` model in `models.py` now includes `protocol`, `source_ip`, and `custom_description` fields. `PortActionRequest` and `VMProvisionRequest` schemas in `schemas.py` are updated to accept these. `generate_port_forward_commands` in `vyos.py` is enhanced to use these parameters. Relevant API endpoints in `routers.py` are modified to process them. Documentation has been updated in `README.md`, `docs/api-reference.md`, and `docs/EXAMPLES.md`.

### 3. Monitoring and Alerting Integration

*   **Objective:** Improve operational visibility and enable proactive issue detection by integrating with common monitoring and alerting tools.
*   **Current Status:** Implemented.
*   **Details:** Prometheus metrics are exposed at `/metrics` using `prometheus_client`. The `/v1/health` endpoint in `routers.py` is enhanced to check database and VyOS connectivity. Structured logging is configured in `main.py` to output JSON format. Conceptual alerting integration is outlined in `docs/monitoring.md`. Documentation has been updated in `README.md` and `docs/monitoring.md`.

### 4. Database Migrations

*   **Objective:** Enable controlled and versioned evolution of the database schema, making schema changes manageable and reproducible in production environments.
*   **Current Status:** Implemented.
*   **Details:** `alembic` is added to `requirements.txt` and initialized. `alembic.ini` and `migrations/env.py` are configured to work with the project's models and database. An initial migration script has been generated. `main.py`'s `on_startup` now integrates Alembic to run migrations automatically. A new `docs/database-migrations.md` file details Alembic usage.

## Conclusion of Phase 3

Phase 3 will significantly enhance the operational robustness of the API, provide more granular control over network configurations, and establish best practices for monitoring and database management.
