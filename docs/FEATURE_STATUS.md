# VyOS VM Network Automation API - Feature Status and Roadmap

This document consolidates the status of features and the implementation roadmap for the VyOS VM Network Automation API. It draws information from `Phase-1-Roadmap.md`, `Phase-2-Roadmap.md`, `Phase-3-Roadmap.md`, and `TODO.md`.

## Phase 1: Core Stability & Security Enhancements

**Status: Completed**

This phase focused on addressing fundamental performance, security, and error handling issues to make the API more robust and reliable.

### 1. Full Asynchronous Implementation
*   **Objective:** Eliminate blocking I/O operations to improve API concurrency and scalability.
*   **Status:** Implemented.
*   **Details:** Database and VyOS API calls now use async-compatible libraries (`sqlalchemy[asyncio]` and `httpx`), and all relevant endpoints have been refactored to `async def`.

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
*   **Objective:** Provide clearer, more consistent, and specific error responses to API consumers and improve internal debugging.
*   **Status:** Implemented.
*   **Details:** Custom exception classes defined, standardized error response schemas in place, `vyos_api_call` raises specific errors, and API endpoints have centralized `try-except` blocks for consistent error responses.

### 3. Secure VyOS API Communication
*   **Objective:** Ensure secure communication with the VyOS router by validating SSL certificates.
*   **Status:** Implemented.
*   **Details:** `httpx` calls in `vyos.py` updated to set `verify=True`, enforcing SSL/TLS certificate validation. Documentation in `docs/security.md` and `docs/vyos-installation.md` updated with configuration instructions.

## Phase 2: Advanced Authentication & Management

**Status: Completed**

This phase builds upon the stable core established in Phase 1 to introduce more sophisticated user management and resource pooling.

### 1. Full JWT Authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
*   **Objective:** Implement a complete, secure JWT authentication flow with user roles for fine-grained access control.
*   **Status:** Implemented.
*   **Details:** The `User` model is defined in `models.py`, user CRUD operations are in `crud.py` with `passlib[bcrypt]` for hashing. The `/v1/auth/token` endpoint handles login and JWT generation. `get_jwt_user` in `main.py` validates tokens and extracts roles. Admin endpoints in `admin.py` use `get_admin_api_key` for RBAC. Documentation has been updated across `README.md`, `docs/api-reference.md`, `docs/security.md`, `docs/EXAMPLES.md`, and `docs/user-guide.md`.

### 2. IP/Port Pool Management API
*   **Objective:** Allow dynamic definition and management of IP and port ranges via API endpoints, moving away from environment variables for resource configuration.
*   **Status:** Implemented.
*   **Details:** `IPPool` and `PortPool` models are defined in `models.py` with CRUD operations in `crud.py`. Admin endpoints for pool management are in `admin.py`. Resource allocation logic in `crud.py` now uses these database-configured pools. Documentation has been updated across `README.md`, `docs/api-reference.md`, `docs/user-guide.md`, `docs/EXAMPLES.md`, and `docs/vyos-installation.md`.

## Phase 3: Operational Robustness & Advanced Features

**Status: Completed**

This phase focuses on enhancing the operational aspects and introducing more advanced network automation capabilities.

### 1. VyOS Configuration Synchronization and Rollback
*   **Objective:** Ensure database and VyOS configurations are always in sync and provide recovery mechanisms for failed operations.
*   **Status:** Implemented.
*   **Details:** The `/v1/admin/sync-vyos-config` endpoint is implemented to compare and synchronize VyOS NAT rules with the database. It identifies and applies `set` or `delete` commands for discrepancies. Database operations are atomic. Rollback mechanisms are conceptually outlined in `docs/operations.md`. Documentation has been updated in `README.md`, `docs/api-reference.md`, and `docs/operations.md`.

### 2. Advanced Port Management
*   **Objective:** Provide more granular control over port forwarding rules, allowing for more specific and flexible NAT rule configurations.
*   **Status:** Implemented.
*   **Details:** The `VMPortRule` model in `models.py` now includes `protocol`, `source_ip`, and `custom_description` fields. `PortActionRequest` and `VMProvisionRequest` schemas in `schemas.py` are updated to accept these. `generate_port_forward_commands` in `vyos.py` is enhanced to use these parameters. Relevant API endpoints in `routers.py` are modified to process them. Documentation has been updated in `README.md`, `docs/api-reference.md`, and `docs/EXAMPLES.md`.

### 3. Monitoring and Alerting Integration
*   **Objective:** Improve operational visibility and enable proactive issue detection by integrating with common monitoring and alerting tools.
*   **Status:** Implemented.
*   **Details:** Prometheus metrics are exposed at `/metrics` using `prometheus_client`. The `/v1/health` endpoint in `routers.py` is enhanced to check database and VyOS connectivity. Structured logging is configured in `main.py` to output JSON format. Conceptual alerting integration is outlined in `docs/monitoring.md`. Documentation has been updated in `README.md` and `docs/monitoring.md`.

### 4. Database Migrations
*   **Objective:** Enable controlled and versioned evolution of the database schema, making schema changes manageable and reproducible in production environments.
*   **Status:** Implemented.
*   **Details:** `alembic` is added to `requirements.txt` and initialized. `alembic.ini` and `migrations/env.py` are configured to work with the project's models and database. An initial migration script has been generated. `main.py`'s `on_startup` now integrates Alembic to run migrations automatically. A new `docs/database-migrations.md` file details Alembic usage.
