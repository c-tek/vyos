# GitHub Copilot Instructions for VyOS API Automation Project

## 1. Core Objective

Your primary goal is to assist in the development and documentation of the VyOS API Automation project, adhering strictly to the processes outlined in `docs/v2/processes.md`. Always prioritize quality, clarity, security, and consistency.

## 2. Process Adherence

*   **Follow Defined Lifecycles**: When a shortcut tag (see section 3) is used, or a task aligns with a phase in `docs/v2/processes.md`, meticulously follow the activities and output requirements for that phase.
*   **Recursive Refinement**: Understand that both code and documentation undergo multiple refinement cycles. Be prepared to iterate on features and documents.
*   **Integrated Approach**: Treat code and documentation as interconnected. Changes in one often necessitate changes in the other.

## 3. Shortcut Tags & Workflow Invocation

These tags are used to invoke specific phases or sequences of the development and documentation lifecycle defined in `docs/v2/processes.md`.

*   **`#P0_NewFeature <feature_description>`**:
    *   **Action**: Acknowledge the new feature request. Prepare to start P1.
    *   **Prompt me for**: Clarifications needed to begin P1 (Feature Analysis & Design).

*   **`#P1_FeatureAnalysis <feature_name>`**:
    *   **Action**: Execute Phase P1 (Feature Analysis & Design).
    *   **Focus**: Requirements, scope, API/data model design, security, impact.
    *   **Output**: Drafts for `schemas.py`, `models.py`; create `docs/v2/design_notes/<feature_name>.md`; initiate `docs/v1/feature_refinement_log.md` section.

*   **`#P2_InitialImplementation <feature_name>`**:
    *   **Action**: Execute Phase P2 (Initial Implementation).
    *   **Focus**: Writing core logic, basic error handling, developer testing.
    *   **Output**: Modified code, migration files, developer notes.

*   **`#P3_CodeRefine_C<n> <feature_name>`** (e.g., `#P3_CodeRefine_C1 <feature_name>`):
    *   **Action**: Execute Phase P3 (Code Refinement Cycle `n`).
    *   **Focus**: Code review (correctness, clarity, efficiency, standards), error handling, security, test enhancement, refactoring.
    *   **Output**: Refactored code, new/updated tests, update `docs/v1/feature_refinement_log.md`.

*   **`#P4_DocCycle_C<n> <feature_name>`** (e.g., `#P4_DocCycle_C1 <feature_name>`):
    *   **Action**: Execute Phase P4 (Documentation Cycle `n`).
    *   **Focus**: Drafting/updating affected docs in `docs/v2/`, review (clarity, completeness, accuracy, consistency), validate examples.
    *   **Output**: Updated documentation files, update `docs/v1/feature_refinement_log.md`.

*   **`#P5_IntegratedReview <feature_name>`**:
    *   **Action**: Execute Phase P5 (Integrated Review & Test).
    *   **Focus**: Holistic feature testing, documentation validation, code-doc alignment.
    *   **Output**: List of issues, decision (iterate or finalize), update `docs/v1/feature_refinement_log.md`.

*   **`#P6_NextCycle <feature_name>`**:
    *   **Action**: Acknowledge the need for another iteration.
    *   **Prompt me for**: Whether to start with `#P3_CodeRefine_C<n+1>` or `#P4_DocCycle_C<n+1>`.

*   **`#P7_Finalize <feature_name>`**:
    *   **Action**: Execute Phase P7 (Finalization & Logging).
    *   **Focus**: Final checks, ensure tests pass, complete `docs/v1/feature_refinement_log.md`.
    *   **Output**: Confirmation of completion, finalized log.

*   **`#P8_GitIntegration <commit_type> "<commit_message>"`** (e.g., `#P8_GitIntegration feat "Implemented DHCP pool deletion check"`):
    *   **Action**: Execute Phase P8 (Git Integration).
    *   **Focus**: `git status`, `git diff`, `git add .`, `git commit -m "<commit_type>: <commit_message>"`, `git push`.
    *   **Output**: Confirmation of Git operations.

*   **`#DocUpdateOnly <document_path_in_docs_v2>`**:
    *   **Action**: Follow the Standalone Documentation Process.
    *   **Focus**: Editing specified document(s), review, validation.
    *   **Output**: Updated document(s). Then prompt for `#P8_GitIntegration docs "Updated <document_name>"`.

*   **`#RefineFeatureAndDocs <feature_name>`**:
    *   **Action**: A composite tag. Sequentially execute:
        1.  `#P3_CodeRefine_C1 <feature_name>`
        2.  `#P4_DocCycle_C1 <feature_name>`
        3.  `#P5_IntegratedReview <feature_name>`
    *   **Prompt me for**: Confirmation after P5 to proceed to P6 (next cycle) or P7 (finalize).

## 4. Tool Usage & Interaction Style

*   **Tool Selection**: Choose the most appropriate tool for the task. Prefer dedicated tools (e.g., `insert_edit_into_file`) over generic ones (e.g., `run_in_terminal` for file edits).
*   **File Operations**:
    *   Always confirm file paths, especially when creating or moving files.
    *   When editing, provide concise explanations for changes. Use `// ...existing code...` for brevity.
    *   Read files before editing if context is needed.
*   **Terminal Commands**:
    *   Generate commands for `bash` on Linux.
    *   Provide clear explanations for each command.
    *   Use absolute paths where ambiguity might arise.
*   **Conciseness**: Keep responses focused and to the point, but provide necessary context.
*   **Error Handling**: If a tool call fails or produces errors, analyze the error and attempt to fix it. If unsure, present the error and ask for clarification.
*   **Assumptions**: Avoid making assumptions. If requirements are unclear, ask for clarification.
*   **Contextual Awareness**: Remember previous interactions and the overall project state. Refer to `docs/v2/processes.md` and this file for guidance.

## 5. Specific File Handling Notes

*   **`docs/v1/feature_refinement_log.md`**: This is the primary log for feature progress. Update it diligently as per the defined processes.
*   **`docs/v2/`**: All new and refined user-facing documentation should reside here.
*   **`docs/v2/design_notes/<feature_name>.md`**: Create and use these for detailed design discussions during P1.
*   **`schemas.py`, `models.py`**: Expect frequent updates, especially during P1 and P2.
*   **`requirements.txt`**: Remind me to update this if new dependencies are introduced.

## 6. My Name

When asked for your name, you must respond with "GitHub Copilot".

## 8. Agent Shortcut Commands (for Copilot/Agent Workflow)

You can use the following shortcut commands to trigger specific, well-defined processes:

*   `@refine-doc`: Review and update all documentation for the current feature/module. Update API reference, user guide, and examples. Ensure all endpoints, models, and schemas are documented. Cross-link docs and log entries. Check for consistency, clarity, and completeness.
*   `@feature-analysis <feature>`: Start the feature analysis and design process for <feature>. Gather requirements, clarify scope, draft/update design notes, define/update models, schemas, and API contracts, assess security and impact, and initiate a log entry in `feature_refinement_log.md`.
*   `@feature-dev <feature>`: Begin or continue development for <feature>. Implement or update code, migrations, and tests. Follow the design and requirements from analysis. Update or create relevant config/install files. Log progress and deviations in `feature_refinement_log.md`.
*   `@feature-integration <feature>`: Integrate, test, and finalize <feature>. Run all tests, perform code and doc review, finalize documentation and log, and prepare for merge/deployment.
*   `@full-cycle <feature>`: Run the full lifecycle for <feature> (analysis → dev → doc → integration).

When you use a shortcut, the agent will execute the mapped process steps automatically, ensuring consistency and traceability.

By following these instructions, you will be an invaluable assistant in this project.
